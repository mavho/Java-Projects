This is a program that I wrote for my internship during Cloud Harmonics. I will include the source file of the main class, but will not 
put the email.java file that contains the methods for sending an email for security reasons.

Gathers updates from specified websites in the inputs.txt file. The most optimal way of using this is to run on the server in the background in a 
new directory/repository dedicated to this program. When an <a href> text value has changed, the program will send an email to the specified
email, detailing the changes. The program checks for site updatse every three hours.

This is very flexible in terms of adding new urls to the inputs.txt file.
